# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) challenges. Each subdirectory corresponds to one daily challenge. Each challenge has two parts. Sometimes I have separate code solutions for the two parts, other times a single program serves as both solutions. Some of my solutions are quick and dirty (or lazy) while others are over-engineered. Each solution should output descriptive help information if run with -h. I may add additional README files for individual solutions if it's warranted. Note that ultimately, my only metric for whether the program "works" is if it provides the correct answer for the purposes of the AoC challenge.

This year, my intention is to write all my solutions in Rust, which I don't know well.
